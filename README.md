# Projeto e Análise de Algoritmos (1/2020) - Sorts

Deve-se implementar os algoritmos de Busca Binária, Insertion Sort e Merge Sort seguindo as especificações de desempenho do site SPOJ.

Para testar foram disponibilizados arquivos de teste simples no diretório test.

Especificação do site SPOJ para os algoritmos desenvolvidos :
____

# Busca Binária

You are given a sorted array of numbers, and followed by number of queries, for each query if the queried number is present in the array print its position, else print -1.

## Input
First line contains N Q, number of elements in the array and number of queries to follow,

Second line contains N numbers, elements of the array, each number will be 
$$ -10^9<= ai <= 10^9, 0 < N <= 10^5, 0 < Q <= 5*10^5 $$

## Output
For each element in the query, print the elements 0 based location of its first occurence, if present, otherwise print -1.

# Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a classical sorting technique. One variant of insertion sort works as follows when sorting an array a[1..N] in non-descending order:

~~~
for i <- 2 to N
    j <- i
    while j > 1 and a[j] < a[j - 1]
        swap a[j] and a[j - 1]
        j <- j - 1
~~~

The pseudocode is simple to follow. In the ith step, element a[i] is inserted in the sorted sequence a[1..i - 1]. This is done by moving a[i] backward by swapping it with the previous element until it ends up in it's right position.

As you probably already know, the algorithm can be really slow. To study this more, you want to find out the number of times the swap operation is performed when sorting an array.

## Input
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. The first line for each case contains N, the number of elements to be sorted. The next line contains N integers a[1],a[2]...,a[N].

## Output
Output T lines, containing the required answer for each test case.

## Constraints
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= a[i] <= 1000000

# Merge Sort

Simple. Sort the numbers on the standard input using the merge sort algorithm. Don't try to cheat by just calling your build in functions... I can see your source.

## Input
On the standard input you will receive N (1 <= N <= 100000). Each number will fit in 32-bit integer

## Output
Output the same integers in a sorted manner. Smallest to largest.
